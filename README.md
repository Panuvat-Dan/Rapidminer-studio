# Data analytics with Rapidminer-studio (non-programming software)
## Ultimate goal
- Find businessinsight from raw data
- Convert insight to information and then data product to end-users
## Date create 
15 November 2020
## Project title
Data mining with rapidminer studio
## Description
1.How to Install (windows)
>>>To start RapidMiner, you can use the RapidMiner.exe file located in the same directory as this readme. If you do not want to/cannot use .exe file, you can also start RapidMiner via the RapidMinerGUI.bat batchfile in the /scripts folder. Starting RapidMiner via the rapidminer.jar is not recommended as doing so will break the update mechanism of RapidMiner. https://rapidminer.com/get-started/

2.Commnity 
>>>>Reach to community to find solution and suggestion https://community.rapidminer.com/

#### Data analytic by data mining and machine learning technique on rapidminer studio
1. Supervised learning (predictive task with machine learning to learn the pattern from large data set) 

>>>> predict the data by classification / linear regression with several algorithms like decision tree,regression and nueral network 

2. Unsupervised learning (describe task or data mining on the past information to find a business new insgiht)

>>>> to find market/business insight  by K-mean clustering / associating rule mining with several algorithms like decision tree,regression and nueral network

3. Reinforced learning (***Do not include on this project)

>>>> to study behavior of end-user and optimise an error by trial process e.g recommendation system of amazon / trend forecasting / text mining / social monitoring analysis 

#### Algoristms support

## Processes 

Overview  Data preparation > Data modeling > Data evaluation > Production

1.Data preparation is to pre processing e.g. cleansing , transforming , reducing the data 

For example,the raw data for example which column should be numeric or catagoric type or even cleaning the raw data which one is not necessary and get rid of it value, and find missing value 

2.Data modeling is to train and test the data by applying the machine learning or deep learning algoristhms 

For example, apply model on raw data to predict form large data set

3.Data evaluation is to compared the algoristhms between different model we have done on the project to see the accuracy 

4.Production is to summarize the data and write the data to CSV or file in order to send the data to others department to contact end-users

For example, after evaluating the model we summatize that 100 significant return customer we shall write the data to csv file to Marketing&Sale to contact the 100 customers instead of all customers to give a voucher or any campaign related to bring the loyal customers to the company again
